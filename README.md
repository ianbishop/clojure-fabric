# Clojure-fabric, Hyperledger Fabric SDK for Clojure using Java SDK

Clojure-fabric is a Clojure wrapper of Hyperledger Fabric SDK.

## Status

   * Low level wrapper functions are all done by generating Clojure code from Java SDK.
   * It is just enough to interact and learn Hyperledger to develop applications.
   * No frills and not Clojure friendly yet.
   * Some high level functions are written(and this will be the main focus for a while)
   
## Files

All files except 'core.clj' are generated and should not be modified. 
Whenever there are any Java SDK changes, they will be updated.
The code generation code is not included in this repository.
