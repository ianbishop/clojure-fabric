;; Client implementation of "Fabric SDK Design Spec"
;; 
;; Main interaction handler with end user. A client instance provides a handler to interact
;; with a network of peers, orderers and optionally member services. An application using
;; the SDK may need to interact with multiple networks, each through a separate instance of
;; the Client.
;; Each client when initially created should be initialized with configuration data from
;; the consensus service, which includes a list of trusted roots, orderer certificates and
;; IP addresses, and a list of peer certificates and IP addresses that it can access.
;; This must be done out of band as part of bootstrapping the application environment.
;; It is also the responsibility of the application to maintain the configuration of a client
;; as the SDK does not persist this object.
;; Each Client instance can maintain several chains representing channels and the associated
;; sub-ledgers.
