;; User implementation of "Fabric SDK Design Spec"
;; 
;; The User class represents users that have been enrolled and represented by an enrollment
;; certificate (ECert) and a signing key. The ECert must have been signed by one of the CAs
;; the blockchain network has been configured to trust. An enrolled user (having a signing key
;; and ECert) can conduct chaincode deployments, transactions and queries with the Chain. 
;; User ECerts can be obtained from a CA beforehand as part of deploying the application,
;; or it can be obtained from the optional Fabric COP service via its enrollment process.
;; Sometimes User identities are confused with Peer identities. User identities represent
;; signing capability because it has access to the private key, while Peer identities
;; in the context of the application/SDK only has the certificate for verifying signatures.
;; An application cannot use the Peer identity to sign things because the application doesn’t
;; have access to the Peer identity’s private key.
