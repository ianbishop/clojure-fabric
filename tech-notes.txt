* gRPC stub mapping between Java and Clojure
(See https://grpc.io/docs/reference/java/generated-code.html)

There are three types of stubs: asynchronous, blocking, and future.
- Async uses StreamObserver
- Blocking only supports server-streaming, no client/bidirectional-streaming
- Future does not support streaming

Supporting Async (and/or Blocking) seem good enough.

* Cryptography
- PKI(Public Key Infrastructure) : CAs.
- CA(Certificate Authority) : CA provides a signed public key as a part of PKI.
- CSR(Certificate Signing Request) : format to submit to CA.
- PKCS(Public Key Cryptography Standards) : a password container format, fully encrypted.
- ASN.1(Abstract Syntax Notation One): a formal language standard, which is used to describe X509.
- X509 : a standard for public key certificate format.
- PEM(Privacy Enhanced Mail) : a container format for public cert.
  or cert chain(pub key, private key, root certificates). May encode CSR as PKCS10 format, etc.
  Usually base64 encoded x509 ASN.1 keys.
- KEY : a .key file is PEM formatted version of private key.
- DER : a canonical method to encode ASN.1 syntax in binary.
  For example, a .pem file is a base64 encoded der.
