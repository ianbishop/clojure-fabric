* gRPC stub mapping between Java and Clojure
(See https://grpc.io/docs/reference/java/generated-code.html)

There are three types of stubs: asynchronous, blocking, and future.
- Async uses StreamObserver
- Blocking only supports server-streaming, no client/bidirectional-streaming
- Future does not support streaming

Supporting Async and Blocking seem good enough.
